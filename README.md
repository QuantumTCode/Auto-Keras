# Auto-Keras - Start to Finish Model Training
## AutoKeras is a library developed to automate the model selection process. This repo makes it even easier to train a model, all you give is the dataset, how long you want to train, and what size images you want. The code takes care of the rest.

Just make sure that each class folder images is in the data folder, and run AutoKeras-DataTrain.py, which will preprocess all your data, and also start training. 

AutoKeras-Train.py can be run once the dataset is preprocessed for training new models. 

The visualization for the models will be included in the model folder at the end of training.

This code was developed for testing for PlantVillage, but anyone can use it. =)
